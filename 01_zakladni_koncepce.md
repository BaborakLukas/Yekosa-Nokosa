# 01 – Basic Game Concept

## 1. Name and Genre
- **Working title:** Yekosa Nokosa
- **Genre:** 2D platformer, survival, co-op

## 2. Target Player
- **Age:** ~15+
- **Player experience:** casual
- **Player motivation:** fast, stylish, retro-looking co-op game where you fight to survive and protect something important

## 3. Premise / Story Background
The world has been overrun by **system bugs** - corrupted, insect-like entities that are slowly destroying reality. The last hope is **The Mother**, a protected core that will give birth to the future savior. The two brothers must hold the line, collect power shards, and keep The Mother alive long enough.

## 4. Core Idea / Hook
- One player can **transform into a gun / weapon form**, and the other player can **pick them up and use them** - creating a co-op combo.
- Players can **upgrade their weapons** by collecting **shards** dropped from defeated bugs.
- The game pushes **teamplay** - playing together is stronger than playing alone.

## 5. Player Activities (simplified core loop)
- player **→** defends The Mother
- player **→** kills a bug
- player **→** collects shards
- player **→** buys or unlocks an upgrade
- player **→** proceeds to the next wave


## 6. Setting and Style
- **Environment:** neon city / 80's Miami aesthetic
- **Time:** retro-future (future, but with 80's vibes)
- **Visual style:** retrowave, pixel-art, strong colors (purple, pink, cyan), glitch elements

## 7. Limitations and Scope
- 2D platformer
- Local / shared co-op (2 players)
- Short game (up to ~20 minutes per run)
- School project - focus on **gameplay, movement, and some spice** (responsiveness, effects), graphics stylized rather than realistic

## 8. Inspirations
- **Similar games:** *Kingdom Two Crowns* (progression / defending something), wave-based games
- **What I'm taking from them:** simple progression, defending a something, upgrades
- **What I don't want:** slow movement, passive gameplay, muted graphics, dark ages aesthetic
